/*
1. Code Structure
At its simplest, JavaScript is made up of a series of statements and semi-colons.

A statement is like a sentence — but in code.

For example, this is a statement:

alert('Say hi');

Semi-colons are not compulsory and can be committed when there is a physical line break in between. It’s the equivalent of a full stop.

But sometimes, line breaks do not guarantee that the statement is done. Using + signs can act as a connector between lines.

For example:

console.log('This ' + name + ' is gibrish');
