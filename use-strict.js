"use strict"

var x = 3.14;
console.log(x);

/*
2. “use strict”
For a long time, JavaScript didn’t have to worry about backward compatibility. Why? Because feature releases never overlapped — until it did.

In 2009, ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released and new features modified some of the existing ones. By default, modifications are not applied unless you enable it using "use strict"

"use strict" must be placed at the top of your JavaScript code or else it won’t get applied.

Nowadays, always "use strict" because we don’t want to use the older implementations of JavaScript.
